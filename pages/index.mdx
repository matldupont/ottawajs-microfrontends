# Hah! You wish.

They don't give a shit.

## So who cares?!

## The infamous demo üòà

# Microfrontends   

... WTF?!

<Cover />

---

## Back to it!

# Microfrontends

---

Think:
## Frontend for microservices

---
<Steps>
  <Step><p>A type of architecture where web apps are divided into different modules</p></Step>
  <Step><p>Parts are implemented autonomously</p></Step>
  <Step><p>Provide frontend teams the same level of flexibility and speed that microservices provide to backend teams</p></Step>
</Steps>

---

## *Build-time vs Run-time integration

---

The most popular method... right now

## Module Federation

---

## Module Federation !== Microfrontend

A transport layer, nothing more.

<Steps>
  <Step><h2>A mechanism to</h2></Step>
  <Step><p>Tell an app that part or all of it should be exposed as a module</p></Step>
  <Step><p>Tell another app where to find exposed modules to consume</p></Step>
</Steps>

---

Exposing a module (with Wepack):

```js
const packageJson = require("./package.json");

module.exports = {
  ...
  plugins: [
      new ModuleFederationPlugin({
        name: "booking",
        filename: "remoteEntry.js",
        exposes: {
          "./BookingApp": "./src/bootstrap",
        },
        shared: packageJson.dependencies,
      }),
      ...
  ],
}
```

---

Consuming a module from a container App:

```js
const packageJson = require("./package.json");

module.exports = {
  ...
  plugins: [
      new ModuleFederationPlugin({
        name: "container",
        remotes: {
          booking: "booking@http://localhost:8081/remoteEntry.js",
          settings: "settings@http://localhost:8082/remoteEntry.js",
        },
        shared: packageJson.dependencies,
      }), 
      ...
  ],
}
```

---

## Becomes a regular import!


```js
import { Booking } from "booking/BookingApp";
```

---

<Steps>  
  <Step><p>Boil down to JS modules with everything required to run</p></Step>
  <Step><p>... with code splitting!</p></Step>
</Steps>


---

# Huh? Show me!

---

# I lied. 

It's not quite that simple

---
 
## Mounting the apps

A React child app:

```jsx
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import BookingApp from "./app";

function mount(el) {  
  ReactDOM.render(<BookingApp history={history} />, el);
}
```

```js
import { mount } from "booking/BookingApp";
```


---

## Mounting the apps

A SolidJS child app:

```jsx
import { render } from "solid-js/web";
import { Settings } from "./components/Settings";

export const mount = (el) => {
  render(Settings, el);
};
```
---



## Mounting the apps

The container app:

```jsx
import * as React from "react";
import { mount } from "booking/BookingApp";

export default function BookingApp() {
  const ref = React.useRef(null);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    mount(ref.current);
  }, []);

  return <div ref={ref} />;
}
```

---

## Further code splitting

```jsx
const BookingLazy = React.lazy(() => import("./components/BookingApp"));

...
  <React.Suspense fallback={<div>LOADING....</div>}>
    <BookingLazy />
  </React.Suspense>
...

```

## Hold the phone! SolidJS!?

  <Step><p>Yes, even with shared dependencies</p></Step>
  <Step><p>Some level of increased complexity</p></Step>

# Navigation!?

A combination a of Browser and Memory routers that need to be synchronized.
